// ============================================================================
// Capture — how a headless run observes the game
// ============================================================================
// Two things leave the game during a scripted run: pictures and facts. Both go
// out through here, and the game never learns what is done with them.
//
//   Telemetry    - a plain value a state fills in on request. InputState is a
//                  value IN; this is the value OUT. No JSON, no file I/O in
//                  states/ - the dev/ harness serialises it however it likes.
//   CaptureSink  - the four hook points of one tick. PlayingState::render
//                  calls the middle two at the only moments the canvas and
//                  the back buffer are complete; Application brackets the
//                  tick with the outer two. Null in the shipping game, so the
//                  cost is one pointer test per hook.
//
// Kept in core/ so a state depends on nothing under dev/ to be observable.
// ============================================================================
