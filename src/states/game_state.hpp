// update/render. PlayingState is the only concrete state today; the main menu
// and death screen are Phase 4.
//
// TRANSITIONS ARE A MAILBOX, NOT A CALL.
// A state never swaps itself out. It raises a request (requestState /
// requestQuit) and Application honours it *between* frames, once render() has
// returned. Swapping inside update() would destroy the object still executing
// on the stack — the classic use-after-free in a naive state machine.
